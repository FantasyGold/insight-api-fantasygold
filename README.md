# *FantasyGoldAPI*

*FantasyGoldAPI* is an open-source fantasygold blockchain REST
and websocket API. FantasyGoldAPI runs in NodeJS and uses LevelDB for storage. 

This is a backend-only service. If you're looking for the web frontend application,
take a look at https://github.com/pembo210/fantasygold.

*FantasyGoldAPI* allows to develop fantasygold-related applications (such as wallets) that 
require certain information from the blockchain that fantasygoldd does not provide.

A blockchain explorer front-end has been developed on top of *FantasyGoldAPI*. It can
be downloaded at [Github FantasyGoldRepository](https://github.com/pembo210/fantasygold).


## Prerequisites

* **fantasygoldd** - Download and Install [fantasygold](https://github.com/fantasygold-project/fantasygold)

*FantasyGoldAPI* needs a *trusted* fantasygoldd node to run. *FantasyGoldAPI* will connect to the node
through the RPC API, fantasygold peer-to-peer protocol, and will even read its raw block .dat files for syncing.

Configure fantasygoldd to listen to RPC calls and set `txindex` to true.
The easiest way to do this is by copying `./etc/fantasygoldd/fantasygold.conf` to your
fantasygold data directory (usually `~/.fantasygold` on Linux, `%appdata%\fantasygold\` on Windows,
or `~/Library/Application Support/fantasygold` on Mac OS X).

fantasygoldd must be running and must have finished downloading the blockchain **before** running *FantasyGoldAPI*.fantasygold


* **Node.js v0.10.x** - Download and Install [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/).

* **NPM** - Node.js package manager, should be automatically installed when you get node.js.

## Quick Install
  Check the Prerequisites section above before installing.

  To install FantasyGoldAPI, clone the main repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/pembo210/fantasygold-api && cd fantasygold-api

  Install dependencies:

    $ npm install

  Run the main application:

    $ nvm use 0.10.40
    $INSIGHT_NETWORK=livenet BITCOIND_HO="127.0.0.1" BITCOIND_USER=liteuser BITCOIND_PASS=litepass INSIGHT_PUBLIC_PATH=public BITCOIND_P2P_PORT=8332 npm start

  Then open a browser and go to:

    http://localhost:3001

  Please note that the app will need to sync its internal database
  with the blockchain state, which may take some time. You can check
  sync progress at http://localhost:3001/api/sync.


## Configuration

All configuration is specified in the [config](config/) folder, particularly the [config.js](config/config.js) file. There you can specify your application name and database name. Certain configuration values are pulled from environment variables if they are defined:

```
BITCOIND_HOST         # RPC fantasygoldd host
BITCOIND_PORT         # RPC fantasygoldd Port
BITCOIND_P2P_HOST     # P2P fantasygoldd Host (will default to BITCOIND_HOST, if specified)
BITCOIND_P2P_PORT     # P2P fantasygoldd Port
BITCOIND_USER         # RPC username
BITCOIND_PASS         # RPC password
BITCOIND_DATADIR      # fantasygoldd datadir. 'testnet3' will be appended automatically if testnet is used. NEED to finish with '/'. e.g: `/vol/data/`
INSIGHT_NETWORK [= 'livenet' | 'testnet']
INSIGHT_PORT          # FantasyGoldapi port
INSIGHT_DB            # Path where to store fantasygold's internal DB. (defaults to $HOME/.fantasygold-insight)
INSIGHT_SAFE_CONFIRMATIONS=6  # Nr. of confirmation needed to start caching transaction information   
INSIGHT_IGNORE_CACHE  # True to ignore cache of spents in transaction, with more than INSIGHT_SAFE_CONFIRMATIONS confirmations. This is useful for tracking double spents for old transactions.
ENABLE_MAILBOX # if "true" will enable mailbox plugin
ENABLE_CLEANER # if "true" will enable message db cleaner plugin
ENABLE_MONITOR # if "true" will enable message db monitor plugin
ENABLE_EMAILSTORE # if "true" will enable a plugin to store data with a validated email address
ENABLE_RATELIMITER # if "true" will enable the ratelimiter plugin
LOGGER_LEVEL # defaults to 'info', can be 'debug','verbose','error', etc.
ENABLE_HTTPS # if "true" it will server using SSL/HTTPS

```

Make sure that fantasygoldd is configured to [accept incoming connections using 'rpcallowip'](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin).

In case the network is changed (testnet to livenet or vice versa) levelDB database needs to be deleted. This can be performed running:
```util/sync.js -D``` and waiting for *fantasygold* to synchronize again.  Once the database is deleted, the sync.js process can be safely interrupted (CTRL+C) and continued from the synchronization process embedded in main app.

## Synchronization

The initial synchronization process scans the blockchain from the paired fantasygoldd server to update addresses and balances. *fantasygold-api* needs exactly one trusted fantasygoldd node to run. This node must have finished downloading the blockchain before running *fantasygold-api*.

While *fantasygold* is synchronizing the website can be accessed (the sync process is embedded in the webserver), but there may be missing data or incorrect balances for addresses. The 'sync' status is shown at the `/api/sync` endpoint.

The blockchain can be read from fantasygoldd's raw `.dat` files or RPC interface. 
Reading the information from the `.dat` files is much faster so it's the
recommended (and default) alternative. `.dat` files are scanned in the default
location for each platform (for example, `~/.fantasygold` on Linux). In case a
non-standard location is used, it needs to be defined (see the Configuration section).
As of June 2014, using `.dat` files the sync process takes 9 hrs.
for livenet and 30 mins. for testnet.

While synchronizing the blockchain, *fantasygold-api* listens for new blocks and
transactions relayed by the fantasygoldd node. Those are also stored on *fantasygold-api*'s database.
In case *fantasygold-api* is shutdown for a period of time, restarting it will trigger
a partial (historic) synchronization of the blockchain. Depending on the size of
that synchronization task, a reverse RPC or forward `.dat` syncing strategy will be used.

If fantasygoldd is shutdown, *fantasygold-api* needs to be stopped and restarted
once fantasygoldd is restarted.

### Syncing old blockchain data manually

  Old blockchain data can be manually synced issuing:

    $ util/sync.js

  Check util/sync.js --help for options, particulary -D to erase the current DB.

  *NOTE*: there is no need to run this manually since the historic synchronization
  is built in into the web application. Running *fantasygold-api* normally will trigger
  the historic sync automatically.


### DB storage requirement

To store the blockchain and address related information, *fantasygold-api* uses LevelDB.
Two DBs are created: txs and blocks. By default these are stored on

  ``~/.fantasygold-insight/``

Please note that some older versions of fantasygold-API store that on `<fantasygold's root>/db`.

This can be changed at config/config.js. As of June 2014, storing the livenet blockchain takes ~35GB of disk space (2GB for the testnet).

## Development

To run FantasyGoldlocally for development with grunt:

```$ NODE_ENV=development grunt```

To run the tests

```$ grunt test```

## Caching schema

Since v0.2 a new cache schema has been introduced. Only information from transactions with
INSIGHT_SAFE_CONFIRMATIONS settings will be cached (by default SAFE_CONFIRMATIONS=6). There 
are 3 different caches:
 * Number of confirmations 
 * Transaction output spent/unspent status
 * scriptPubKey for unspent transactions

Cache data is only populated on request, i.e., only after accessing the required data for
the first time, the information is cached, there is not pre-caching procedure.  To ignore 
cache by default, use INSIGHT_IGNORE_CACHE. Also, address related calls support `?noCache=1`
to ignore the cache in a particular API request.

## API

By default, FantasyGoldprovides a REST API at `/api`, but this prefix is configurable from the var `apiPrefix` in the `config.js` file.

The end-points are:


### Block
```
  /api/block/[:hash]
  /api/block/00000000a967199a2fad0877433c93df785a8d8ce062e5f9b451cd1397bdbf62
```
### Transaction
```
  /api/tx/[:txid]
  /api/tx/525de308971eabd941b139f46c7198b5af9479325c2395db7f2fb5ae8562556c
```
### Address
```
  /api/addr/[:addr][?noTxList=1&noCache=1]
  /api/addr/mmvP3mTe53qxHdPqXEvdu8WdC7GfQ2vmx5?noTxList=1
```
### Address Properties
```
  /api/addr/[:addr]/balance
  /api/addr/[:addr]/totalReceived
  /api/addr/[:addr]/totalSent
  /api/addr/[:addr]/unconfirmedBalance
```
The response contains the value in Satoshis.
### Unspent Outputs
```
  /api/addr/[:addr]/utxo[?noCache=1]
```
Sample return:
``` json
[
    {
      address: "n2PuaAguxZqLddRbTnAoAuwKYgN2w2hZk7",
      txid: "dbfdc2a0d22a8282c4e7be0452d595695f3a39173bed4f48e590877382b112fc",
      vout: 0,
      ts: 1401276201,
      scriptPubKey: "76a914e50575162795cd77366fb80d728e3216bd52deac88ac",
      amount: 0.001,
      confirmations: 3
    },
    {
      address: "n2PuaAguxZqLddRbTnAoAuwKYgN2w2hZk7",
      txid: "e2b82af55d64f12fd0dd075d0922ee7d6a300f58fe60a23cbb5831b31d1d58b4",
      vout: 0,
      ts: 1401226410,
      scriptPubKey: "76a914e50575162795cd77366fb80d728e3216bd52deac88ac",
      amount: 0.001,
      confirmation: 6    
      confirmationsFromCache: true,
    }
]
```
Please note that in case confirmations are cached (which happens by default when the number of confirmations is bigger that INSIGHT_SAFE_CONFIRMATIONS) the response will include the pair confirmationsFromCache:true, and confirmations will equal INSIGHT_SAFE_CONFIRMATIONS. See noCache and INSIGHT_IGNORE_CACHE options for details.

## Web Socket API
The web socket API is served using [socket.io](http://socket.io).

The following are the events published by fantasygold:

'tx': new transaction received from network. This event is published in the 'inv' room. Data will be a app/models/Transaction object.
Sample output:
```
{
  "txid":"00c1b1acb310b87085c7deaaeba478cef5dc9519fab87a4d943ecbb39bd5b053",
  "processed":false
  ...
}
```


'block': new block received from network. This event is published in the 'inv' room. Data will be a app/models/Block object.
Sample output:
```
{
  "hash":"000000004a3d187c430cd6a5e988aca3b19e1f1d1727a50dead6c8ac26899b96",
  "time":1389789343,
  ...
}
```

'<fantasygoldAddress>': new transaction concerning <fantasygoldAddress> received from network. This event is published in the '<fantasygoldAddress>' room.

'status': every 1% increment on the sync task, this event will be triggered. This event is published in the 'sync' room.

Sample output:
```
{
  blocksToSync: 164141,
  syncedBlocks: 475,
  upToExisting: true,
  scanningBackward: true,
  isEndGenesis: true,
  end: "000000000933ea01ad0ee984209779baaec3ced90fa3f408719526f8d77f4943",
  isStartGenesis: false,
  start: "000000009f929800556a8f3cfdbe57c187f2f679e351b12f7011bfc276c41b6d"
}
```

### Example Usage

The following html page connects to the socket.io FantasyGoldAPI and listens for new transactions.

html
```
<html>
<body>
  <script src="http://<fantasygold-server>:<port>/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
  <script>
    eventToListenTo = 'tx'
    room = 'inv'

    var socket = io("http://<fantasygold-server>:<port>/");
    socket.on('connect', function() {
      // Join the room.
      socket.emit('subscribe', room);
    })
    socket.on(eventToListenTo, function(data) {
      console.log("New transaction received: " + data.txid)
    })
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```
